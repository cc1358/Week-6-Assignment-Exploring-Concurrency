We accomplish the task of predicting the response variable mv (median value of homes in thousands of 1970 US dollars) from subsets of four or more of the explanatory variables, and compute the mse and aic information criterion. The boston1.go explores this method in Go without concurrency, while the boston2.go file explores this with concurrency. After running each program 100 times, we document runtimes in the excel file. The first Go code has an average CPU runtime of 148.05 ms , while the second one has a noticeably quicker runtime of 79.47 ms runtime. This demonstrates the incredible usefulness of using concurrency to accomplish regression tasks in Go with concurrency. When running large batches of regression tasks, it becomes obvious that concurrency is a vital method that provides computational efficiency. I would strongly recommend management to incorporate concurrency methods to decrease runtime in regression tasks, among others.
